## Impulse Dash Overview

The Impulse is a dashboard browser extension that appears upon the opening of a new tab. Currently, the dashboard displays one of a bunch of pre-loaded excerpts from essays I've enjoyed. All excerpts have a title and a link to their source webpage. 

These excerpts draw from essays written by a variety of inspirational figures. Their topics range from life, investing, startups, and other miscellaneous categories I find interesting.

#### How To Install
You can download the code by clicking the green "Clone Or download" button in the top right corner of the page. If you download the zip -- be sure to unzip the files. Otherwise, download the code using `git clone`.

The following instructions are for the Chrome browser, but the extension is likely to work similarly on other browsers. Once you have the source code, go to the extensions panel of Chrome by inserting `chrome://extensions/` in the browser search bar. Turn on "Developer Mode" if necessary (top right), and then click the "Load unpacked" button on the top left. Search your filesystem and select the folder which contains the Impulse Dash source files.

Open a new tab and see if the extension is working. If you have another extension installed that also overrides the new-tab screen, you may have to disable that extension. 

#### Issues / Contributing

If you notice any issues with the extension, feel free to submit an issue through Github or open a pull request. I'll try to review it as quickly as possible.
